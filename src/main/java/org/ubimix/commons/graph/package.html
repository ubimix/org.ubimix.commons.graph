<p>This package contains classes used to iterate over graph structures.</p>
<p>The basic class for all other structures is the Walker class. It translates 
simple calls to the <code>#begin(Object)</code>/<code>#end()</code> methods to 
corresponding calls of the IWalkerListener class. Walker instances are used
internally by the following high-level classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphIterator/IteratorBasedGraphIterator - these classes are used to iterate 
over graph structures.</li>
<li>TreeBuilder - this class is used to transform a sequence of paths into the
corresponding graph structure.</li>
</ul>
